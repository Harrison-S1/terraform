This is a dev enviroment for AWS. You will need to create a user in AWS to deploy this.

- Log into your AWS account.
- Navigate to IAM and select Users on the left hand menu
- Select "Add users"
- Create the username
- Select "Access key - Programmatic access" and click next
- Select "Attach existing policies directly" and use the "AdministratorAccess" policy
> Dont do this for productions
- Tags are optional, so just click next, then create user

Now on the next page you need to add the details from user, access key ID and Secret access key to the aws credentials file.
```bash
~/.aws/credentials
```

> For example
```bash
[terraformuser]

# This key identifies your AWS account.

aws_access_key_id = QKIAUDRQURVLS2JCIV4

# Treat this secret key like a password. Never share it or store it in source

# control. If your secret key is ever disclosed, immediately use IAM to delete

# the key pair and create a new one.

aws_secret_access_key = nBhpjpTCyerter3sdf0l3QZ7zxV78ptCF
```

You will also want to create a new ssh key for this env called `clouddev` with
```BASH
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```

This will build the following:

- VPC
- Public subnet
- Internet Gateway
- Route Table
- Route Table Association
- Security Group
- Key Pair
- Ubuntu 22.04 instance (t2 micro), with the AMI detailed in the datasources.tf file
- IAM role to allow the instance to communicate with AWS CloudWatch
- IAM profile to attach to the instance

The **userdata** will update the instance, install and set up the cloudwatch configuration file, install docker and add the user to the docker group.
